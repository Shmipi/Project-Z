# Project-Z
A 2D Side scroller detective tech demo developed for the Neighbours Game Jam by a team of 4.

This tech demo was inspired by older arcade games and the 2004 "The Batman" Plug n' Play game by JAKKS Pacific Inc.
We wanted to explore those mechanics of searching an old warehouse for clues and tools, in order to deduce how to escape and where the main antagonist is hiding.
